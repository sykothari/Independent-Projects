# Independent-Projects
## Introduction:
Hi, my name is Shikha Kothari and I'm an M.S. Health Informatics graduate student at the University of California, Davis. I have a primarily clinical background (medical degree), but currently exploring the realm of health technology and informatics and loving it! 

## Areas of Focus:
At present, my interests are quite broad but I lean towards clinical informatics, decision support, data science, data warehousing, standardization of clinical vocabularies and facilitating interoperability of and access to healthcare data for patient care / clinical research purposes. 

## PubMed Search Tool:
As a part of my final project for the UC Davis MHI 289I course, I created a script for a PubMed search tool which can be run on any python interpreter. The user is prompted for keyword(s) to search, as well as the maximum number of publications to retrieve. The output is a list of PubMed ID's sorted by relevance, followed by formatted citations with abstract text for each PubMed ID.
