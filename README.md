# Independent-Projects
## Introduction:
Hi, my name is Shikha Kothari and I'm an M.S. Health Informatics graduate student at the University of California, Davis. I have a primarily clinical background (medical degree), but currently exploring the realm of health technology and informatics and loving it! 

## Areas of Focus:
At present, my interests are quite broad but I lean towards clinical informatics, decision support, data science, data warehousing, standardization of clinical vocabularies and facilitating interoperability of and access to healthcare data for patient care / clinical research purposes. 

## PubMed Search Tool:
As a part of my final project for the UC Davis MHI 289I course, I created a script for a PubMed search tool that can be run on a python interpreter. The user is prompted for keyword(s) they would like to find articles on, and the number of articles they would like. The output is a list of PubMed ID's sorted by relevance, as well as a list of formatted citations with abstract text for each PubMed ID.
